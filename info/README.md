# Best Chess

## [Play Best Chess in your browser or on your phone](https://pippinbarr.github.io/best-chess/) (HTML5)

_Best Chess_ was written in JavaScript using the excellent libraries [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/blob/master/README.md) and [chessboard.js](http://chessboardjs.com/), without which it would have been far too much work to bother with. The depth-first chess-solving algorithm is of my own (incredibly awkward and inefficient) creation. Please let me know if you happen to read it and notice a problem.

_Best Chess_ has been written about on [Kill Screen](http://killscreendaily.com/articles/best-chess-uses-all-computational-power-just-mess-your-mind/)Â and [Matajuegos](http://mata.juegos/en/2016/07/minimal-input-games-and-the-exploration-of-juice/).
