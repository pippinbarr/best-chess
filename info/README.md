## Description
*You have always dreamed of your computer solving chess! Or your phone! The ultimate act of computation! Make a move! Sit back! Relax! Only the best for you! Very thorough! Very thoughtful! Good things take time!*

_Best Chess_ was written in JavaScript using the excellent libraries [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/blob/master/README.md) and [chessboard.js](http://chessboardjs.com/), without which it would have been far too much work to bother with. The depth-first chess-solving algorithm is of my own (incredibly awkward and inefficient) creation. Please let me know if you happen to read it and notice a problem.
